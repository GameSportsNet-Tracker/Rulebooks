Insults and unfair or disrespectful behaviour towards anyone are not tolerated and will be punished.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Every participant must always have the newest version of Steam and Dota 2 installed and must check for updates with enough time to download and install them before each match. Unless a new version comes out right before the match, patching is not a valid reason to delay it.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Every participant including stand-ins must be registered on joindota.com and have their correct steam ID entered as a game account in the GameSports network.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Every team and participant must try to win every game at any point of joinDOTA League Brawls.

This helps admins to coordinate as a team and work faster on issues than with the help of other platforms. Any other form of communication may be ignored.</p><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Confidentiality</h3><br><br>All direct communication between teams and the organizers is confidential.
