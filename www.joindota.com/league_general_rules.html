A group of participants fulfilling the minimum required number of team members will be called a "team" in the following.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">By signing up to the joinDOTA League, participants acknowledge without limitation to comply with the rules and regulations and with the statements and decisions made by the administration.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Every participant acknowledges the right for the administration to modify the rules and regulations for adjustments at any time without notice and, if necessary, overrule those to ensure fair play throughout each season.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Every participant must show respect towards admins and other participants. Insults and unfair or disrespectful behaviour towards anyone are not tolerated and will be punished.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Every participant must always have the newest version of Steam and Dota 2 installed and must check for updates with enough time to download and install them before each match. Unless a new version comes out right before the match, patching is not a valid reason to delay it.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Every participant including stand-ins must be registered on joindota.com and have their correct steam ID entered as a game account in the GameSports network.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Every team and participant must try to win every game at any point of the joinDOTA League.

Any other form of communication may not be accepted as valid by the administration in case of conflict. This specifically includes chat via the Steam client.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">The administration may only be contacted via <a href="https://www.joindota.com/en/users/support" target="_blank">support tickets</a>. This helps admins to coordinate as a team and work faster on issues than with the help of other platforms. Any other form of communication may be ignored.</p><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Confidentiality</h3><br><br>All direct communication between teams and the organizers is confidential. This includes reports, protests or any form of interactions with admins. The publication of any of the above is forbidden, unless the organizers give explicit permission in a written statement.<br><br><a class="ge-anchor" name="activity"></a><br><h2 class="ge-block ge-counter-1">Activity <span class="ge-inline" style="color: #ec1c23;"></span></h2><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-2">By signing up for the joinDOTA League, teams agree to actively participate. To avoid causing inconvenience for other teams, every team must show up to their match dates.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Any team which is unable or no longer wishes to actively take part in the league after signing up should communicate this to our league administration through a <a href="https://www.joindota.com/en/users/support" target="_blank">support ticket</a>. Only tickets sent in by the team leader will be accepted in these cases.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Any team which does not show up to two matches within a phase will be disqualified from the current season.

This means the team will automatically be relegated to the lowest sub-division.</p><br><br><a class="ge-anchor" name="league"></a><br><h2 class="ge-block ge-counter-1">League Structure <span class="ge-inline" style="color: #ec1c23;"></span></h2><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Phases</h3><br><br>Each season has four (4) different periods during which the team performance determines their advancement into another higher or lower skilled group or division. These periods are called phases. These phases have the following names:<br><br><ul class="ge-block ge-ul"><br><li>Phase 0 or Calibration Phase (Further explained in <a href="https://www.joindota.com/en/statics/league_general_rules#calibration">Rule 4</a>)<br></li><li>Phase 1<br></li><li>Phase 2<br></li><li>Phase 3</li></ul><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Groups</h3><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">The league is divided into an unlimited number of groups. The number of groups always depends on the number of teams that sign up.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Each group consists of up to 4 teams, depending on the structure of the currently ongoing phase. Each team is in one group during a phase. Within a phase of a season teams only compete with the other teams in their group.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Each team will be in assigned a group based on their performance in the previous phase. Teams compete with other teams in the same group in a given Phase.</p><br><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Divisions</h3><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Each group is part of a division. The division roughly classifies the skill level of teams playing inside the division. The best teams of a league are part of the Premier Division, the next best teams in Division 2, and so forth. The number of divisions can change between seasons.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Each division consists up to three (3) sub-divisions.</p><br><br><ul class="ge-block ge-ul"><br><li>Upper sub-division (U), for example Asia 3U.1<br></li><li>Middle sub-division (M)<br></li><li>Lower sub-division (L)</li></ul><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">The sub-division of a team is defined by the results of either their last phase of the previous season or the previous phase of the ongoing season including the Calibration Phase (see group format for more details). Teams signing up for the first time but do not participate in the Calibration Phase will be placed in a group within the lowest division.</p><br><br><a class="ge-anchor" name="calibration"></a><br><h2 class="ge-block ge-counter-1">Calibration Phase <span class="ge-inline" style="color: #ec1c23;"></span></h2><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Sign-up</h3><br><br>Teams must specifically sign-up and check-in for the Calibration Phase in order to participate in them. The Calibration Phase will be played at the end of the sign-up phase of the regular season. Exact dates are announced on www.joindota.com.<br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Transitions</h3><br><br>Depending on the results in the Calibration Phase, a team may be placed between Division 2 and the last sub-Division in their region. A detailed distribution will be announced shortly before the Calibration Phase. Teams who competed in previous seasons may play in the Calibration Phase if they want to. Teams can only improve or maintain their sub-division placement in this case, they cannot be relegated to a lower sub-division.<br><br><a class="ge-anchor" name="group"></a><br><h2 class="ge-block ge-counter-1">Group Format <span class="ge-inline" style="color: #ec1c23;"></span></h2><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Matches</h3><br><br>All teams within a group compete in a round robin consisting of two-game series. Therefore, each team plays two games against every other team in their group. Each set of two games between two teams are grouped as a match. A match result (2:0, 0:2, or 1:1) must be confirmed by both teams or an admin on the match page.<br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Ranking</h3><br><br>The rank of a team within the group is decided by its number of games won.<br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Transitions</h3><br><br>The transitions of each placement within a group depends on the number of participants and is defined at the start of each phase.<br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Ties</h3><br><br>If two or more teams are tied with the same number of wins after all matches are played, deciding games are played to decide about their rank, unless all involved positions have the same transition. The format of the tiebreak depends on the number of involved teams. If two teams are tied, one game is played. If three teams are tied, a one game round robin is played. In case of another tie time rating applies. If four or more teams are tied, the format will be announced by the administration.<br><br><a class="ge-anchor" name="teams"></a><br><h2 class="ge-block ge-counter-1">Teams and Players</h2><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Team Size</h3><br><br>A team must consist of at least five (5) and at most ten (10) participants. Those persons will be called "team members" or "members" of the team in the following.<br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Registration</h3><br><br>In order to sign up for the joinDOTA League, a team must have at least five (5) members with valid steam IDs.<br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Eligible Players <span class="ge-inline" style="color: #ec1c23;"></span></h3><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">A player may only take part in a match as a team member if they haven't joined the team within 24 hours of the official match time. Otherwise, they will count as a stand-in and the team must comply with the stand-in rules.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">A player needs to apply to change the Steam ID associated with their GameSports network account at least 24 hours before the official match time.</p><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Stand-ins <span class="ge-inline" style="color: #ec1c23;"></span></h3><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Stand-ins are participants playing for a team during a game who are not team members.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">The maximum number of stand-ins a team may use is limited to two (2) players per game. Exception are the Calibration Phase, where no standins may be used.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">A stand-in may not be a member of a team from a higher sub-division during the season or the same group in the current phase.</p><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Player and Roster Restrictions <span class="ge-inline" style="color: #ec1c23;"></span></h3><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Only the person that is marked as leader can transfer their leadership to another person. The leadership can also be forcefully changed if more than 50% of the team members decide on a new leader. This must be requested via a <a href="https://www.joindota.com/en/users/support" target="_blank">support ticket</a>.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Each team may add up to one (1) new player to their team during each phase. If a team does not use all available roster changes, they will expire at the end of the given phase.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">A player may only change their team once per season. Therefore, a player cannot return to their original team within a season after they have joined a new team.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">A player may only play for up to three (3) different teams per season. This includes standing in for a team. If a player has played for three (3) different teams in a season and attempts to join another team, they are not eligible to play for that new team.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">A team may use up to three (3) different stand-ins and the same stand-in once in each phase.</p><br><br><a class="ge-anchor" name="schedule"></a><br><h2 class="ge-block ge-counter-1">Schedule</h2><br><br><h3 class="ge-block ge-counter-2">Default times <span class="ge-inline" style="color: #ec1c23;"></span></h3><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">Match times in the Calibration Phase cannot be changed. All matches must be played on the default dates. If a match is delayed due to at least one team still playing a previous round's match, the new default time is set to 15 minutes after the end of that ongoing match.</p><br><br><p class="ge-block ge-counter-3">While teams are encouraged to schedule their matches on any day of the week during each phase, a default date exists each week as a starting point for scheduling. The default day is always the Sunday of the match week and the time depends on the region:<br><br></p><ul class="ge-block ge-ul"><br><li>joinDOTA League Asia: <span class="tztime"
